Mostly built as a joke.

Platform for users to upload locations built in their Valheim worlds to serve as a directory to other members of their Valheim world. 

Users can tag their locations with helpful information like Forge Levels, whether thare are open beds, and how secure the location is. Users can also upload images of their locations.
